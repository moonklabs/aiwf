# Optional MCP servers for the Angular/JPA skills

The `aiup-angular-jpa` skills work without any MCP servers — they fall back to your
own knowledge and the documentation links inside each skill. For authoritative,
up-to-date docs, API lookups, and CLI-integrated tooling, configure the optional MCP
servers below in your agent. They are advisory only; nothing in these skills
hard-requires them.

## Servers

| Server      | Type  | URL / command                  | Used by                                       |
|-------------|-------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| JavaDocs    | http  | `https://www.javadocs.dev/mcp` | `implement`, `spring-boot-test`               |
| playwright  | stdio | `npx @playwright/mcp@latest`   | `playwright-test` (running browser tests)     |

## Configure in Claude Code

Add these to your project's `.mcp.json` (the Tessl `tessl mcp start` bridge can stay
alongside them):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "JavaDocs": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://www.javadocs.dev/mcp"
    },
    "playwright": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

For other agents (Cursor, Gemini, Codex, Copilot), add the same servers to that
agent's MCP configuration file.

## Frontend docs already covered by `aiup-core`

`aiup-core`'s `.mcp.json` wires up **context7** (`https://mcp.context7.com/mcp`), a
general library-documentation server. Because it resolves docs for any npm/JS package on
demand, it already covers Angular, RxJS, and Vitest — the libraries the `implement` and
`vitest-test` skills rely on for the frontend. If you have `aiup-core` installed (a
prerequisite for this plugin — see the top-level README), you get frontend doc lookups
for free without configuring anything extra here.

## Note for Tessl-installed users

Tessl does not ship MCP server definitions with a plugin — installing this plugin via
`tessl install` configures only the Tessl bridge. Configure the servers above manually
if you want the enhanced documentation lookups. Users who install the plugin through
the Claude Code marketplace get these servers automatically from the plugin's
`.mcp.json`.

## Future opportunity

`aiup-vaadin-jooq` ships purpose-built MCP servers for jOOQ and Karibu Testing that the
plugin author built and hosts himself. No equivalent exists yet for Spring Data JPA/
Hibernate specifically — a dedicated server following that same pattern would be a
natural addition here, but isn't included today.
