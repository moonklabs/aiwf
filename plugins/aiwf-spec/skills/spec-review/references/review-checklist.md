# Semantic Review Checklist

The checks below need understanding, so `spec_lint.py` cannot make them. Each one says what to look for, where, and
how to tell a finding from a false alarm. Severity is `warning` when the defect will make the implementation or the
tests wrong, and `info` when it only makes the specification harder to read or maintain. Never `error`.

## 1. Contradictions

**Where:** business rules across all use cases; rules against the Main Success Scenario and alternative flows of
their own use case; rules against NFRs and constraints in `requirements.md`.

Two statements contradict when no system can satisfy both for the same input: different limits for the same
quantity (6 vs 12 months, 18 vs 21 years), a state one use case allows and another forbids, an alternative flow that
ends where a rule says the use case must continue. Different rules for different actors or states are not a
contradiction — check the conditions before reporting.

Report the finding on the later of the two rules and name the other one (`UC-009 BR-001`). Severity: `warning`.

## 2. Duplication in other words

**Where:** business rules across use cases.

The same rule written differently in two places drifts apart with the next change. The lint catches identical text
(`BR_DUPLICATE`); you catch the paraphrase — same condition, same consequence, different wording. The fix is to keep
the rule in the use case that owns the data and cite it elsewhere as `UC-xxx BR-yyy`. Severity: `warning` when the
two wordings could be read differently, `info` when they are equivalent.

## 3. Wrong level

**Where:** steps, alternative flows, and business rules of a use case.

A use case states what the actor and the system achieve, not how the screen looks or how the data is stored:

- UI detail: colors, positions, widget types, pixel sizes, "clicks the blue button", "selects from the dropdown in
  the top right"
- Technical detail: table and column names, "stores in table X", REST calls, queues, caches, framework or class names

Naming the business action ("Clerk confirms the booking") is fine; naming a button label the business insists on is
fine when the specification says so. `validate_use_case.py` already flags a fixed list of protocol terms
(`TECHNICAL_TERM`); report what that list misses. Severity: `info`, `warning` when the detail constrains the
implementation in a way nobody decided.

**Where, too:** the use case as a whole — its name in `docs/use_cases.puml`, its goal, and its Main Success
Scenario.

Every use case should be a user goal: ask *is this use case a complete goal that the primary actor would recognize as
valuable?* Report a use case that fails the question:

- Subfunction: a step of a larger goal, usually technical — "Validate METAR", "Load NOTAM", "Persist Result". Its
  scenario is two or three system steps with no result the actor would ask for. Name the user goal it belongs to
  ("Determine Airport Suitability"), which may already exist in the diagram.
- Summary: an area of work spanning several sittings — "Manage Flight Operations". Name the user goals it splits
  into. Signs of a summary in the Main Success Scenario: the work is handed over to another role, the scenario waits
  for an outside event or a deadline, or branches run in parallel for different actors. Name the business process
  that connects the split use cases as well, to be modeled in BPMN in `docs/processes/`.

A subfunction the diagram draws as an `<<include>>` from several use cases is intended; do not report it. Severity:
`warning` for a technical step modeled as a use case of its own, `info` otherwise. The fix belongs to
`/use-case-diagram`.

## 4. Completeness

**Where:** the Main Success Scenario, alternative flows, and postconditions.

- A step that can fail — a validation, a lookup, a payment, a call to another system, a concurrent change — without
  an alternative flow whose trigger references that step (`(step N)`)
- A failure postcondition that is not a minimum guarantee: a system reaction ("System displays an error message")
  or a statement true for only one failure path. Failure postconditions must hold for every unsuccessful end
- A failure path that would break a failure postcondition — e.g. an alternative flow that ends after a partial
  write the guarantees rule out
- A precondition that nothing establishes: no other use case produces the state it requires
- A business rule that no step or flow applies
- A Main Success Scenario that does not lead from the trigger to the goal: it starts somewhere other than the event
  in `**Trigger:**`, or its last step and the success postconditions do not achieve what the Overview `**Goal:**`
  promises (the goal says "books a room", the scenario ends when the availability is shown)

Severity: `warning`.

## 5. Testability

**Where:** business rules, postconditions, and requirement rows the use case references.

A rule is testable when a test can set up the input and decide pass or fail from what the system shows or stores.
Untestable: "the system handles large volumes", "data is kept secure", "the user is informed in time". Suggest the
measurable version (a number, a limit, an observable message). Severity: `warning`.

Then judge the use case as a whole as the basis for `/test-case` and the test skills: every path — the main success
scenario and each alternative flow — must end in a result a test can observe (a success postcondition, a failure
guarantee, or the step where the flow continues), and every business rule must have a path that exercises it. Report
a path that ends without an observable result, or a rule no path reaches, once per use case rather than per step.
Severity: `warning`.

## 6. Ambiguity

**Where:** everywhere.

- A missing actor: passive voice that hides who acts ("the data is checked" — by the system or by the clerk?)
- Unclear quantities and ranges: "some", "several", "large", "recent", "up to date"; boundaries without
  inclusive/exclusive ("between 1 and 10")
- Pronouns with two possible referents ("it", "they" after two nouns)
- Undefined domain terms: a term that carries business meaning but is neither in `glossary.md` nor explained where it
  is used; the same thing called by two names across documents

Weak words from the fixed list are the lint's job (`WEAK_WORD`); report what the list cannot catch. Severity:
`info`, `warning` when the two readings lead to different behavior.

## 7. Entity model consistency

**Where:** steps, rules, and postconditions against `docs/entity_model.md`.

Specifications name data in business words, so judge from context, not from spelling: "the guest's email" matches
`GUEST.email`; "the booking" matches `RESERVATION` when the model has no other candidate. Report:

- data a use case reads, shows, or records that matches no entity or attribute
- a rule that implies a constraint the model contradicts (a rule says "optional", the model says `Not Null`; a rule
  lists four statuses, the model's `Values:` lists three)
- a relationship a flow relies on that the model does not have

Skip this check when there is no entity model. Severity: `warning`.

## 8. Trigger and preconditions

**Where:** the Overview's `**Trigger:**` line (German: `**Auslösendes Ereignis:**`) and the Preconditions of each use
case.

The trigger is the event that starts the use case — an actor's request, a point in time, a message from an external
system. A precondition is a state that is already true and that the use case does not check again. Ask "when does
this happen?": an event has a moment, a state does not. Report:

- a trigger that is a state ("Flight data is available", "User is logged in") — it belongs in the Preconditions
- a precondition that is an event or an actor action ("User clicks New Order", "Dispatcher requests an assessment")
  — it is the trigger, or step 1
- a precondition that is established or evaluated during the use case — it depends on input given in a step ("A room
  is available for the requested dates" when the dates are entered in step 4), a step checks it, or an alternative
  flow handles its violation; then the fact is not a precondition but a condition the use case has to check, and the
  precondition should name only the stable state it rests on ("Room inventory is configured")
- a step 1 that repeats the trigger word for word instead of starting the interaction

A missing trigger line is `info` (older documents have none; `/use-case-spec` writes it for new ones). The validator
already flags an empty trigger, a `(step N)` in it, and a trigger that copies a precondition verbatim; report what
needs judgment. Severity: `warning` for a state written as a trigger, an event written as a precondition, or a
precondition the use case evaluates itself, `info` otherwise.

## 9. Actors

**Where:** the Overview's `**Primary Actor:**` and `**Secondary Actors:**` lines against the steps, the alternative
flows, `docs/use_cases.puml`, and the roles in `requirements.md` and `glossary.md`.

A use case may have several primary actors, listed comma-separated: roles that can each start the use case on their
own and pursue the same goal through the same main success scenario. Report:

- a primary actor that is not a role: "System", the system under design, or a generic "User" when the requirements
  and the glossary distinguish roles (Clerk, Manager) that the use case should name
- primary actors joined with "or" or "and" ("Clerk or Manager") — the list is comma-separated, and each entry stands
  for a role that can pursue the goal alone
- several primary actors who pursue different goals, or who need different main success scenarios (one role books,
  the other approves) — that is two use cases, or one primary actor and a secondary actor
- a primary actor that only supports the use case — it answers a request or provides a service but does not pursue
  the goal; it belongs in `**Secondary Actors:**`
- a role or an external system that acts in a step or an alternative flow ("Payment Service confirms the payment",
  "Manager approves the discount") but is listed as neither a primary nor a secondary actor
- an actor in the specification that the diagram does not connect to the use case, or the other way round

Severity: `warning` for "System" as a primary actor, for roles that pursue different goals, and for an external system
missing from the actors (an implementation may build it instead of integrating it); `info` otherwise. The fix for the
diagram belongs to `/use-case-diagram`.

## 10. Non-functional requirements and constraints

**Where:** the `**Requirements:**` line of each use case against the `NFR-*` and `C-*` rows of `requirements.md`.

The lint checks that every listed id exists and that every FR is covered; it cannot tell whether a use case forgot a
quality attribute or a constraint that applies to it. Compare by topic: a response-time NFR for searches and a use
case whose main step is a search; a data-protection NFR and a use case that records personal data; a constraint that
names an external system and the use case that calls it. Report an NFR or a constraint that clearly applies but is
not listed, and name the id.

This is also where UI, API, and technical detail that a use case must respect belongs: a use case does not describe
it in its steps (see §3) but references the NFR or constraint that states it. Report detail in a step that should
be an NFR or a constraint instead.

Skip this check when there is no `requirements.md` or it has no NFRs and constraints. Severity: `info`, `warning`
when the missing NFR or constraint sets a limit a test would check (a response time, a maximum, a mandatory system).
