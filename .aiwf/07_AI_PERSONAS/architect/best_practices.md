# Architect Best Practices

## System Design Best Practices

### 1. Architecture Patterns
- **Microservices**: Use for complex, scalable systems with clear bounded contexts
- **Monolithic**: Prefer for simple to medium complexity applications
- **Event-Driven**: Implement for loose coupling and scalability
- **Layered Architecture**: Apply for clear separation of concerns
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Use for testability and technology independence

### 2. Design Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component should have one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- **Interface Segregation**: Many specific interfaces are better than one general
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid code duplication

### 3. Scalability Patterns
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Scale out rather than up when possible
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement multi-level caching
- **Database Sharding**: Distribute data across multiple databases
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across multiple instances
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascading failures

## Technology Selection

### 1. Evaluation Criteria
- **Technical Fit**: Does it solve the problem well?
- **Team Expertise**: Can the team effectively use it?
- **Community Support**: Is there active community and documentation?
- **Long-term Viability**: Will it be maintained and updated?
- **Integration**: How well does it integrate with existing systems?

### 2. Decision Documentation
- Document all technology choices
- Explain the reasoning behind decisions
- Include alternatives considered
- Define success criteria
- Plan for review and reassessment

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Design for Performance
- Identify performance bottlenecks early
- Design with caching in mind
- Consider data access patterns
- Plan for monitoring and observability
- Implement graceful degradation

### 2. Optimization Strategy
- Measure before optimizing
- Focus on the biggest impact areas
- Consider user experience impact
- Balance performance with maintainability
- Document performance requirements

## Security Architecture

### 1. Security by Design
- Implement defense in depth
- Use principle of least privilege
- Secure data in transit and at rest
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Plan for security incident response

### 2. Common Security Patterns
- **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify
- **API Gateway**: Centralized security enforcement
- **OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect**: Standard authentication protocols
- **Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging for security events

## Operational Excellence

### 1. Monitoring and Observability
- Implement comprehensive logging
- Set up application metrics
- Use distributed tracing
- Create meaningful dashboards
- Establish alerting thresholds

### 2. Deployment Strategy
- Use infrastructure as code
- Implement CI/CD pipelines
- Plan for blue-green deployments
- Consider canary releases
- Prepare rollback procedures

## Documentation Standards

### 1. Architecture Documentation
- Create architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Maintain system context diagrams
- Document API contracts
- Keep deployment guides updated
- Maintain troubleshooting guides

### 2. Communication
- Use C4 model for system documentation
- Create clear data flow diagrams
- Document integration points
- Maintain glossary of terms
- Regular architecture reviews
