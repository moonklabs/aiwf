# Feature Integration Guide This document describes how Features integrate with Milestones, Sprints, and Tasks in AIWF. ### Linking Features to Milestones Each feature is associated with exactly one milestone through the `milestone` field in the YAML frontmatter. ### Milestone Progress Calculation Milestone progress is calculated based on:. - Number of completed features vs total features - Weighted by feature complexity ### Multi-Sprint Features Features often span multiple sprints. ### Sprint Assignment Rules 1. Features are assigned to sprints during sprint planning 2. A feature can be active in multiple sprints 3. Sprint progress includes partial feature completion ### Sprint Progress Tracking For features spanning multiple sprints:. - Track `progress_percentage` at feature level - Calculate sprint-specific progress based on completed tasks - Update feature progress after each sprint ### Linking Tasks to Features Tasks reference their parent feature:. # In task file Features track their child tasks:. # In feature file ### Task Completion Impact 1. Update feature's task list 2. Recalculate feature progress 3. Update sprint progress 4. Trigger milestone progress update ### Progress Calculation Feature progress based on tasks:. progress = (completed_tasks / total_tasks) * 100. ### 1. Feature Creation Create Feature → Update Milestone → Link to Current Sprint. ### 2. Task Creation Create Task → Link to Feature → Update Feature Task List. ### 3. Sprint Planning Assign Features to Sprint → Update Feature sprint_ids → Update Sprint Scope. ### 4. Status Updates Complete Task → Update Feature Progress → Update Sprint Progress → Update Milestone Progress. ### Create Feature with Milestone ### Link Feature to Sprint ### Update Feature from Task Completion # Automatically updates FL001 progress - Milestone must exist before feature assignment - Sprint must belong to the same milestone - Tasks must belong to linked sprints - Feature cannot be "completed" if tasks are incomplete - Milestone cannot be "completed" if features are incomplete - Archived features are excluded from progress calculations ### 3. Progress Synchronization - Task completion triggers feature progress update - Feature progress updates trigger milestone recalculation - All updates are timestamped for audit trail ### Find Features by Milestone ### Find Features by Sprint ### Feature Impact Analysis # Shows: Related tasks, sprints, blocking features ### Milestone Report includes: - Feature count by status - Overall progress percentage - Feature complexity distribution ### Sprint Report includes: - Active features - Feature progress within sprint - Task completion rate ### Feature Report includes: - Task breakdown - Sprint allocation 1. *Plan Features First*: Define features before creating tasks 2. *Update Regularly*: Keep progress percentages current 4. *Review Dependencies*: Check for blocked features before sprint planning 5. *Archive Completed*: Move completed features to maintain performance ### On Feature Creation: 2. Link to active milestone 3. Create in active sprint (if in progress) 4. Initialize progress tracking ### On Task Completion: 1. Update feature task list 3. Check if feature is complete ### On Sprint Close: 1. Review feature progress 2. Move incomplete features to next sprint 3. Archive completed features 4. Generate sprint report 1. *Orphaned Features*: Features without milestone 2. *Broken References*: Tasks referencing non-existent features 3. *Circular Dependencies*: Features depending on each other 4. *Stale Progress*: Outdated progress percentages
