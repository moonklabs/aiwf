# GitHub Integration with AIWF Framework This document provides guidance on integrating GitHub issues and pull requests with the AIWF task management system. The AIWF framework now supports seamless integration with GitHub issues and pull requests, enabling better tracking and collaboration through the `gh` CLI tool. ### 1. Task-Issue Linking - Each task can be linked to a GitHub issue via the `github_issue` field in frontmatter - Automatic status synchronization between tasks and issues - Bidirectional updates ensure consistency - Create GitHub issues from tasks: `/project:aiwf:issue_create {task_id}` - Generate pull requests with issue linking: `/project:aiwf:pr_create {task_id}` - Commit messages automatically include issue references ### 3. Status Management - Task status changes trigger GitHub issue updates - Issues are labeled based on task status (in-progress, completed, etc.) - Comments are added to issues for transparency ### Issue Creation /project:aiwf:issue_create {task_id}. Creates a GitHub issue from a task file with:. - Title including task ID - Description from task content ### Pull Request Creation /project:aiwf:pr_create {task_id}. Creates a pull request that:. - Links to the associated issue - Auto-closes issue on merge Create issue manually:. gh issue create \. ### 1. Issue Creation Timing - Create issues when starting a sprint - Link issues immediately after creation - Update frontmatter with issue number ### 2. Commit Messages - Use `fixes #123` for bug fixes - Use `relates to #123` for partial work - Include task ID in commit message ### 3. Pull Request Workflow - Create PR after task completion - Link to original issue - Request appropriate reviewers ### Task Files - Create issues for all tasks at sprint start - Use labels to group by sprint - Track progress via GitHub Projects - Automatically creates issues if enabled - Creates PRs after successful commits - Maintains full automation flow ### Common Issues 1. *Missing gh CLI*: Install GitHub CLI first - Check task file for valid issue number - Verify GitHub API limits - Ensure branch protection rules allow automation
