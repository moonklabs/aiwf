# Feature Git Integration Specification This document defines how Features integrate with Git version control in AIWF. ### Core Git Fields in Feature YAML # Git branch information git_branch: string  # Associated feature branch. git_base_branch: string  # Base branch (usually main/master). # Commit tracking hash: string,  # Commit SHA. message: string,  # Commit message. date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM,  # Commit timestamp. files_changed: integer,  # Number of files changed. deletions: integer  # Lines deleted. # Pull request tracking status: string,  # open | merged | closed. created_at: timestamp,  # PR creation time. merged_at: timestamp,  # PR merge time (if merged). # Code metrics total_commits: integer,  # Total number of commits. total_lines_added: integer,  # Total insertions. total_lines_removed: integer, # Total deletions. first_commit: timestamp,  # First commit timestamp. last_commit: timestamp  # Most recent commit. ### 1. Feature Branch Creation # Create feature in AIWF /project:aiwf:create_feature_ledger "User Authentication". # Create Git branch git checkout -b feature/FL001-user-authentication. # Link branch to feature #### Automatic Commit Linking Commits mentioning the feature ID are automatically linked:. git commit -m "feat(FL001): implement JWT token generation". git commit -m "[FL001] add password hashing". git commit -m "FL001 - configure auth middleware". #### Manual Commit Linking /project:aiwf:link_feature_commit FL001 abc123def. # Create PR with feature reference gh pr create --title "[FL001] User Authentication Implementation" \. --body "Implements feature FL001: User Authentication System". # Auto-links to feature when title/body contains FL### pattern # Sync PR status to feature ### Feature ID Detection Patterns The following patterns in commit messages trigger auto-linking:. 2. `[FL###]` - Bracketed reference 3. `(FL###)` - Parenthetical reference 4. `feat(FL###):` - Conventional commit format git commit -m "feat(FL001): implement user registration endpoint". git commit -m "[FL001] add email validation to registration". git commit -m "fix(FL001): resolve token expiration bug". git commit -m "test(FL001): add unit tests for auth service". git commit -m "docs(FL001): update API documentation for auth endpoints". # Conventional commit types for features feat(FL###):  # New feature implementation. # Check if commits reference a feature feature_id=$(git diff --cached --name-only | xargs grep -l "FL[0-9]\{3\}" | head -1). # Extract feature ID from commit message feature_id=$(echo "$commit_msg" | grep -o "FL[0-9]\{3\}" | head -1). # Link commit to feature. # Update feature status when PR is merged # Extract feature ID from merged branch. ### Link Current Branch to Feature ### Import Commit History /project:aiwf:import_feature_commits FL001 --since="2025-07-01". ### Generate Feature Changelog ## Commits (15 total) - abc123d feat(FL001): implement JWT token generation (2025-07-08) - def456e [FL001] add password hashing (2025-07-09) - ghi789f fix(FL001): resolve token expiration bug (2025-07-10) ## Pull Requests (2 total) - PR #42: [FL001] User Authentication Implementation (merged) - PR #45: [FL001] Fix token validation (open) ## Code Impact - Files changed: 23 - Lines added: 1,245 - Lines removed: 89 - First commit: 2025-07-08 ### Feature Git Status Feature: FL001 - User Authentication System. Status: 5 commits ahead of main. ### 1. Branch Naming Convention - Pattern: `feature/FL###-descriptive-name` - Auto-created when feature is created - Validated before commits ### 2. Commit Aggregation - Commits are aggregated daily - Metrics updated every 6 hours - Full history preserved ### 3. PR Auto-Updates - PR status synced on webhook - Feature progress updated on merge - Reviewers added to contributors ### 4. Completion Triggers - Feature marked complete when PR merged to main - Notification sent to stakeholders - Metrics finalized ### Feature Velocity Metrics - Average commits per feature - Time from first commit to merge - Code churn rate - Review turnaround time ### Quality Metrics - Code review comments - Bug fix ratio - Refactoring frequency ### Team Metrics - Commits per developer - Review participation - Feature ownership distribution - Collaboration patterns 1. *One Feature, One Branch*: Each feature should have dedicated branch 2. *Atomic Commits*: Make small, focused commits with clear messages 3. *Reference Features*: Always include feature ID in commit messages 4. *Regular Sync*: Run sync commands after significant changes 5. *Clean History*: Squash commits before merging for clarity 1. *Missing Commits*: Run import command to catch up 2. *Broken Links*: Use repair command to fix references 3. *Orphaned Branches*: Clean up after feature completion # Repair feature-git links # Resync all features # Clean orphaned branches
