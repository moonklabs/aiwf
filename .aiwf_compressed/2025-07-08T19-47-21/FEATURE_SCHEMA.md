# Feature Ledger Schema Definition This document defines the data model and schema for Feature Ledger entries in AIWF. ## YAML Frontmatter Schema # Required Fields feature_id: FL###  # Unique identifier (FL + 3-digit number). title: string  # Feature title (max 100 chars). status: enum  # active | completed | archived | paused. created_date: YYYY-MM-DD  # Creation date. last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM  # Last modification timestamp. # Milestone & Sprint Association milestone: M##  # Associated milestone ID. ]  # List of related sprint IDs. tasks: [T##_S##,. ]  # List of related task IDs. # Team & Assignment assignee: string  # Primary assignee username. ]  # List of contributor usernames. ]  # List of reviewer usernames. # Classification priority: enum  # critical | high | medium | low. complexity: enum  # simple | moderate | complex. category: string  # feature | enhancement | bugfix | refactor. # Time Tracking estimated_hours: number  # Estimated hours to complete. actual_hours: number  # Actual hours spent. estimated_completion: YYYY-MM-DD  # Estimated completion date. actual_completion: YYYY-MM-DD  # Actual completion date. # Git Integration git_branch: string  # Associated git branch name. ]  # List of commit hashes. pull_requests: [  # Associated PRs. status: string,  # open | merged | closed. # Dependencies ]  # Feature dependencies. ]  # Features blocked by this one. # Progress Tracking progress_percentage: 0-100  # Overall progress percentage. checklist_items_total: integer  # Total checklist items. checklist_items_completed: integer  # Completed checklist items. # Risk & Issues risk_level: enum  # low | medium | high. # Additional Metadata type: string  # doc | design | spec | discussion. notes: string  # Additional notes (multiline). ### feature_id - Pattern: `FL[0-9]{3}` - Must be unique across all features - Sequential assignment recommended - Required, non-empty string - Maximum 100 characters - Should be descriptive and searchable - Required enum value - Valid transitions: - `active` → `completed`, `paused`, `archived` - `paused` → `active`, `archived` - `completed` → `archived` - `archived` → (no transitions allowed) - ISO 8601 format for all dates - `created_date` is immutable once set - `last_updated` auto-updates on any change ### priority - Default: `medium` - Used for sprint planning and resource allocation ### complexity - Default: `moderate` - Guidelines: - `simple`: < 8 hours estimated - `moderate`: 8-40 hours estimated - `complex`: > 40 hours estimated ### progress_percentage - Calculated based on: - Checklist completion (40%) - Task completion (40%) - Time elapsed vs estimate (20%) - Feature is currently being worked on - Has assigned resources - Appears in active dashboards ### completed - All acceptance criteria met - Code merged to main branch - Tests passing - Documentation updated - Work temporarily halted - Reason documented in notes - Resources reallocated ### archived - No longer relevant - Kept for historical reference - Excluded from active reports ## Example Feature Entry title: User Authentication System. created_date: 2025-07-08. last_updated: 2025-07-08 23:50. sprint_ids: [S01_M02, S02_M02]. tasks: [T01_S01, T02_S01]. assignee: developer1. contributors: [developer2, designer1]. estimated_completion: 2025-07-20. git_branch: feature/FL001-user-auth. - number: 42 title: "Implement JWT authentication". - "Session timeout handling needs refinement" - "Password reset flow requires email service" - "Implement refresh token mechanism" - "Integrate with SendGrid for email delivery" - title: "Authentication Design Doc" - title: "Security Requirements" Initial implementation focuses on JWT-based authentication. Need to consider OAuth2 integration in future sprints. Performance testing required for token validation endpoint.
