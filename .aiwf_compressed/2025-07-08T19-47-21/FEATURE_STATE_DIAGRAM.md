# Feature State Transition Diagram This document defines the state transitions and rules for Feature Ledger entries. ### 1. *active* - Feature is currently being developed - Has active resources assigned - Work is in progress - Appears in sprint boards and active dashboards ### 2. *completed* - All acceptance criteria have been met - Code has been merged to main branch - All tests are passing - Documentation has been updated - Feature is ready for production ### 3. *paused* - Work has been temporarily halted - Resources have been reallocated - Reason for pause is documented - Feature is no longer relevant - Kept for historical reference only - Cannot be transitioned to other states - Excluded from active reports and dashboards ## State Transition Diagram │ active  │  │ paused  │. - *→ completed*: When all work is done and acceptance criteria met - *→ paused*: When work needs to be temporarily halted - *→ archived*: When feature is abandoned or no longer needed - *→ active*: When work resumes - *→ archived*: When decision made not to continue - *→ archived*: When feature is retired or superseded - No transitions allowed (terminal state) ### active → completed - All checklist items marked as complete - All linked tasks have status "completed" - Code review approved and merged - `actual_completion` date is set - All linked PRs have status "merged" - Set `actual_completion` to current date - Update `progress_percentage` to 100 - Notify stakeholders - Update milestone progress ### active → paused - Resource reallocation needed - Blocking dependencies identified - Strategic priority change - Technical blockers discovered - Pause reason documented in `notes` - `known_issues` updated if applicable - Add pause reason to activity log - Notify assignee and stakeholders - Update sprint planning ### paused → active - Resources become available - Blocking dependencies resolved - Assignee available - Dependencies cleared - Notify assignee to resume work - Update sprint allocation - Clear pause reason from notes ### Any → archived - Feature deprecated - Business requirements changed - Superseded by another feature - Archive reason documented - No active dependencies - Move file to `archived/` directory - Update all dependent features - Remove from active reports - Final notification to stakeholders ### Check Current State ### Transition State ### Validate Transition /project:aiwf:validate_feature_transition FL001 active completed. 2. *Auto-archive* completed features after 90 days 3. *Alert* when paused features exceed 14 days 5. *Log* all transitions with timestamp and user ### State Distribution Report - Shows count and percentage by state - Identifies stale features - Tracks state transition velocity ### Transition History - Audit trail of all state changes - Average time in each state - Transition patterns analysis 1. *Document Transitions*: Always add a note explaining why a state change occurred 3. *Regular State Reviews*: Weekly review of paused features 4. *Clear Dependencies*: Update blocked features when completing dependencies 5. *Timely Updates*: Change state as soon as conditions are met
