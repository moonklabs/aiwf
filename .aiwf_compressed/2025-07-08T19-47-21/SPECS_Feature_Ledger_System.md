## Overview Feature Ledger System은 AIWF 프로젝트 내에서 개발 중인 기능들을 체계적으로 추적하고 문서화하는 시스템입니다. Wrinkl 프로젝트의 개념을 차용하여 AIWF의 구조에 맞게 구현합니다. ### Directory Structure │  │  └── FL002_Dashboard_Redesign. ### File Naming Convention - Pattern: `FL###_Feature_Name.md` - FL = Feature Ledger - ### = 3-digit sequential number - Feature_Name = Snake_case feature identifier ### Feature Ledger Entry # Core Identification title: User Authentication System. status: active # active | completed | archived | paused. created_date: 2025-07-08. # Milestone & Sprint Association tasks: [T01_S01, T02_S01]. # Team & Assignment # Classification priority: high # critical | high | medium | low. category: feature # feature | enhancement | bugfix | refactor. # Time Tracking # Git Integration - number: 42 title: "Implement JWT authentication". # Dependencies # Progress Tracking # Risk & Issues risk_level: medium # low | medium | high. known_issues: ["Session timeout handling needs refinement"]. mitigation_plans: ["Implement refresh token mechanism"]. ### Feature States 1. *active*: Currently being developed - Has active resources assigned - Work is in progress - Appears in sprint boards and active dashboards 2. *completed*: Development finished and tested - All acceptance criteria met - Code merged to main branch - Tests passing - Work temporarily halted - Resources reallocated - Kept for historical reference - Cannot be transitioned to other states - Excluded from active reports For detailed state transition rules, see: `. ### 1. Create Feature Ledger /project:aiwf:create_feature_ledger <feature_name>. 1. Generate next available FL### number 2. Create feature ledger file in `active/` directory 4. Update FEATURE_LEDGER_INDEX.md 5. Link to current sprint/milestone if applicable ### 2. Update Feature Status 1. Locate feature file 2. Update status in YAML frontmatter 3. Move file to appropriate directory (active/completed/archived) 4. Update index and timestamps 5. Log status change in feature history ### 3. Link Feature to Git 1. Extract current git branch/commit 2. Add commit reference to feature ledger 3. Auto-update feature progress based on commit message 4. Generate commit section in feature document ### 4. Generate Feature Dashboard ## Active Features (3) - FL001: User Authentication [70% complete] - FL002: Dashboard Redesign [30% complete] - FL004: API Rate Limiting [10% complete] ## Recently Completed (2) - FL000: Initial Setup (2025-07-07) - FL003: Database Migration (2025-07-06) ### M02: Context Engineering Enhancement - Active: 2 - Completed: 1 - Total Progress: 45% ## Integration Points - Pre-commit hook to prompt feature ledger update - Auto-detect feature references in commit messages (e.g., `[FL001]`) - Generate feature-based changelog - Supported commit patterns: - `FL###` - Direct reference - `[FL###]` - Bracketed reference - `feat(FL###):` - Conventional commit format - `fix(FL###):` - Bug fix for feature - `#FL###` - Hash reference - Automatic PR linking when title/body contains feature ID - Branch naming convention: `feature/FL###-descriptive-name` - For detailed Git integration, see: `.aiwf/06_FEATURE_LEDGERS/FEATURE_GIT_INTEGRATION.md` ### Sprint/Task Integration - Features linked to multiple sprints via `sprint_ids` array - Bidirectional linking between features and tasks - Progress calculation based on task completion - Milestone progress aggregated from feature statuses - Integration patterns: - Feature → Sprints (one-to-many) - Feature → Tasks (one-to-many) - Milestone → Features (one-to-many) - For detailed integration guide, see: `.aiwf/06_FEATURE_LEDGERS/FEATURE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` ### AI Context Integration - Include active features in AI context - Compress completed features for token efficiency - Provide feature history on demand ### Feature Ledger Template title: Feature Title. # Feature: {{ title }} Brief description of the feature and its purpose. ## Requirements - [ ] Requirement 1 - [ ] Requirement 2 - [ ] Requirement 3 ### Architecture Changes ### API Changes ### Database Changes - Initial feature ledger created - Design discussion completed - Link to PRD - Link to Technical Spec - Link to Design Mockups - `commit_hash`: Commit message [YYYY-MM-DD] - PR #123: PR title [status] ## Testing Plan - Unit tests required - Integration test scenarios - User acceptance criteria ## Rollout Strategy - Feature flag name: `feature_name_enabled` - Rollout phases - Monitoring plan Additional context or decisions made during development. - Index file updates should be < 100ms - Feature search should support fuzzy matching - Dashboard generation < 1 second - Ensure unique feature IDs - Validate status transitions - Check required fields on creation ### Error Handling - Graceful handling of missing features - Conflict resolution for concurrent updates - Backup before bulk operations ## Migration Plan 1. Scan existing tasks/sprints for features 2. Generate initial feature ledgers 3. Create index from discovered features 4. Prompt user to review and adjust ### Completed Components - ✅ Directory structure created (`.aiwf/06_FEATURE_LEDGERS/`) - ✅ Feature schema defined (`FEATURE_SCHEMA.md`) - ✅ State transition diagram (`FEATURE_STATE_DIAGRAM.md`) - ✅ Integration guide (`FEATURE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`) - ✅ Git integration specification (`FEATURE_GIT_INTEGRATION.md`) - ✅ Feature template (`99_TEMPLATES/feature_template.md`) - ✅ Index file structure (`FEATURE_LEDGER_INDEX.md`) ### Pending Components - ⏳ CLI commands implementation - ⏳ Git hooks setup - ⏳ Dashboard generation - ⏳ Migration scripts 1. *Feature Dependencies*: Track inter-feature dependencies 3. *Visual Timeline*: Generate feature timeline visualization 4. *AI Insights*: Feature completion predictions based on history 5. *Advanced Search*: Full-text search across features 6. *Export Capabilities*: Generate reports in various formats
