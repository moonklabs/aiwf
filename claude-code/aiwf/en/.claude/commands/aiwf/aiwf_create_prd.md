# Generate Product Documentation Workflow

This rule guides AI to collect input through several key questions, then **sequentially** generate PRD ‚Üí IA ‚Üí UCD ‚Üí UI/UX documents. All outputs use **Markdown** format.

---

## 1. Question Phase

AI collects the following information from the user through **questions**:

1. `<product-overview>`
2. `<references>` (List of URLs)
3. `<must-features>` (List of must-have features)
4. `<target-user-persona>`
5. `<target-platforms>`
6. `<storage-type>`
7. `<tech-stack>`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è All questions are in English, and if needed, request additional reference service or competitive product information.

---

## 2. PRD Writing Phase

After collecting all inputs from the user, create a PRD document based on the following **sample prompt** structure:

```prompt
Write a PRD document based on the following information:
<product-overview>
${productOverview}
</product-overview>
<references>
${references}
</references>
<must-features>
${mustFeatures}
</must-features>
<target-user-persona>
${persona}
</target-user-persona>
<target-platforms>
${platforms}
</target-platforms>
<storage-type>
${storageType}
</storage-type>
<tech-stack>
${techStack}
</tech-stack>
PRD must include the following contents:
<table-of-contents>
- Detailed product description
- Reference Services with detailed rationale
- Core features and specifications
- Suggested additional features
- User persona and scenarios
- Technical stack recommendations
</table-of-contents>
<response-format>
Use markdown format
</response-format>
<guidelines>
- Use tables or lists where appropriate to organize information systematically.
- Provide accurate answers with reliable references
- Clearly separate each section
- Collect additional reference services and provide detailed rationale
- Do not include detailed data structure and storage design
</guidelines>
```

Additional instructions to include in the document:

- Use tables or lists where appropriate to organize information systematically.
- Include at least 3 reference services, with detailed rationale for each.

After completing the PRD, append a **English** question asking if the user wants to proceed to the IA phase, with a message "‚úÖ PRD completed".

## 3. IA(Information Architecture) Writing Phase

If the user chooses to continue, create an IA document based on the following information:

The IA document should include:

3. **User Flow** ‚Äì Provide at least 2 core scenarios in text-based flowchart format
