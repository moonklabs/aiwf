# Link Feature Commit

Manually link a Git commit to a Feature in the Feature Ledger.

## Command Usage

```bash
/project:aiwf:link_feature_commit <feature-id> <commit-hash>
```

## Parameters

- `feature-id`: The Feature ID (e.g., FL001)
- `commit-hash`: The Git commit hash to link (full or short hash)

## What It Does

1. Retrieves commit information (message, author, date, stats)
2. Links the commit to the specified feature
3. Updates feature status if needed (planned â†’ active)
4. Records the commit in the feature's git_commits array

## Examples

```bash
# Link a specific commit to feature FL001
/project:aiwf:link_feature_commit FL001 abc123def

# Link the latest commit
/project:aiwf:link_feature_commit FL002 HEAD
```

## Implementation

Execute the following command:

```bash
node .aiwf/scripts/git-integration.cjs link-commit {{FEATURE_ID}} {{COMMIT_HASH}}
```

## Notes

- The commit must exist in the current repository
- The feature file must exist in the Feature Ledgers
- Duplicate commits are automatically ignored
- Feature status automatically updates from 'planned' to 'active' on first commit
